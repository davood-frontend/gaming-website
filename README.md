# Gaming shop website

A fullStack project that is built using nextjs which has diffrent routes like shop,about,consoles,games, etc.\
this project is focused on the client side and the front-end since i'm a front-end developer so the local api may not be so perfect.\
this is the first version of this project and hopefully i'm going to add more features to it later.
